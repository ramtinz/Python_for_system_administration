# Here is a simple Python code that performs some basic Linux administrative tasks:

# This code defines several functions that can be used to perform various tasks, such as listing the files in the current directory, creating a new file, deleting a file, setting file permissions, and changing the owner of a file.

import subprocess

def list_files():
  # List all files in the current directory
  subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"])

def create_file(filename):
  # Create a new file with the given name
  subprocess.run(["touch", filename])

def delete_file(filename):
  # Delete the file with the given name
  subprocess.run(["rm", filename])

def set_permissions(filename, permissions):
  # Set the permissions of the file with the given name to the specified value
  subprocess.run(["chmod", permissions, filename])

def change_owner(filename, owner):
  # Change the owner of the file with the given name to the specified user
  subprocess.run(["chown", owner, filename])

  
  # To use these functions, you would simply call them with the appropriate arguments. For example, to list the files in the current directory, you could call list_files(). To create a new file called myfile.txt, you could call create_file("myfile.txt").
