To control and limit the size and number of files to transfer to a mounted drive in a Linux host, you can use a combination of tools and techniques. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Quotas and Disk Limits**:
   Linux supports disk quotas, which allow you to set limits on the amount of disk space a user or a group of users can use on a filesystem. Quotas can be useful to limit the total size of data that can be transferred to a mounted drive.

   a. **Enable Quotas**:
      First, you need to make sure that quotas are enabled on the filesystem. This typically involves modifying the `/etc/fstab` file to include the `usrquota` and `grpquota` options for the relevant filesystems.

   b. **Install and Configure Quota Tools**:
      Install the quota tools package for your distribution. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install quota
      ```
      Then, use the `edquota` command to set disk quotas for specific users or groups.

2. **File Transfer Limits**:
   To limit the number of files transferred, you can use custom scripts, tools, or applications. Here's an example of how to use `rsync` to transfer files and limit the number of files:

   a. **Install rsync**:
      If not already installed, install the `rsync` utility, which is commonly used for file synchronization and transfer.

   b. **Use rsync with `--max-files`**:
      You can use the `--max-files` option to limit the number of files transferred. For example:
      ```bash
      rsync --max-files=100 source_directory/ /path/to/mounted_drive/
      ```
      This will transfer a maximum of 100 files from `source_directory` to the mounted drive.

3. **Custom Scripts**:
   You can also write custom scripts that monitor the number of files and their sizes being transferred, and stop the transfer when a certain limit is reached.

4. **Cron Jobs**:
   You can schedule the file transfers using cron jobs and ensure that they don't exceed the specified limits.

Remember that the specifics of implementing these steps might vary depending on your distribution and use case. Additionally, enforcing these limits might require scripting and careful management. Always test any solutions in a controlled environment before applying them to production systems.
